### CatFetch Reborn
(Currently WIP)
Recreation of catfetch (<https://github.com/jhonnyrice/cat-fetch>) in shell for more accuracy and less bugs.

Uses some GNU core utils and xprop to work. Wm script by Alberto Salvia Novella.

#### Usage
To use the program you'll need to know these options(most importantly the -o option):
```
-o		Displays the actual output [necessary for the other options to make sense]

-s      Adds a separator
-m      Adds the system architecture and graphic session(X11 or WAYLAND) to the output
-d      Adds your dark color palette to the output
-b      Adds your bright color palette to the output
-h      Shows this help message
```

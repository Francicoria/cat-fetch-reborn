### CatFetch Reborn
(Currently WIP)
Recreation of catfetch (<https://github.com/jhonnyrice/cat-fetch>) in shell for more accuracy and less bugs.

Uses some GNU core utils and xprop to work. Wm script by Alberto Salvia Novella.

#### Usage
The possible options are as follow:
```
-h		Shows help message
-m		Adds the system architecture and graphic session(X11 or WAYLAND) to the output
-d		Adds your dark color palette to the output
-b		Adds your bright color palette to the output
```

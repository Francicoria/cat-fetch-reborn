### CatFetch Reborn
(Currently WIP)
Recreation of catfetch (<https://github.com/jhonnyrice/cat-fetch>) in shell for more accuracy and less bugs.

## Installer:

```bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpyLima/cat-fetch-reborn/main/install.sh)```

Uses some GNU core utils and xprop to work.
